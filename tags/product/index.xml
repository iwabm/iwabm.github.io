      <description>-- COLLECTIVE JUICE Interaction Design | 2018, Academic Work  Objective What is the question that can only be answered by humans during the AI era? Everyday we are googling many questions and we can get answer immediately. Also, recently AI can answer more and more sophisticated questions. However, I think still there are things that can only be answered by people such as fuzzy, real-time and people-oriented questions.</description>

      <description>-- LIMPIDUAL TOUCH Interaction Design | 2009, Academic Work  Overview Designed and proposed interactive limpid display with dual-sided touch sensing.   I’ve proposed the emerging interactive transparent display named ‘‘LimpiDual Touch’’. Users can operate from the rear side of the screen while seeing both displayed images and their fingers. This feature resolves a finger occlusion problem. Additionally, LimpiDual Touch also works for multiple users. Two users can share an identical display from both sides and control displayed objects at one time.</description>

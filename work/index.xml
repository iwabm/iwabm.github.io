Design Question:
If we can display information on a transparent surface, how will our experience change? Direct-touch input enables intuitive operation, and touch panels have been mounted on various devices. However, finger occlusion becomes one of the problems when a user touches the display from the front side. Here, inspired from SF movies, one idea to solve this problem is to use &amp;ldquo;transparent&amp;rdquo; display.</description>

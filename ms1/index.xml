      <description>Context - Domain 1 Network Science The first domain I want to research is Network Science. When I reviewed my exploration so far, I found I am interested in creating a network in any kind of way. For example, in 2D and 4D, I tried to create a network and connect people based on background careers or question-answer conversation. Previously I said that my domain is social computing, however, social computing was still broad and it was more intriguing for me to see it from the perspective of the network.</description>

      <description>I picked up an umbrella for critiquing as an interface. An umbrella or parasol is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight. It is said that an umbrella has been used about 4000 years ago and remains in sculptures such as Egypt, Persia, and mural paintings. In many regions, umbrellas have developed to protect the king from sunlight, so they have long been a luxury item, a symbol of wealth and power.</description>

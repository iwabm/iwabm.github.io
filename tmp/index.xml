      <description>Project Overview I personally tried to redesign MTA services because NYC subway riding experience is uncomfortable for me; dirty platform, unexpected stop, morning/evening rush and so on. I conducted the entire design process to specify inconvenient element of the subway and improve services of MTA.
My Role I conducted the whole design process from interviewing with users, defining problem, ideation, prototyping and evaluation.
Background Current research (source) shows that subway and bus ridership has declined while ridership through ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber has increased.</description>

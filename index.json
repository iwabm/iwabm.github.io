[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Breathing Chair is a chair which changes its shape to make people stand up. When people sit for a long time, the chair breathes organically and deform into a difficult shape to sit. After a while, the chair quietly returns to its original state. It leads people toward a state of standing up naturally to prevent sedentary lifestyle.   Problem Our body is designed for regular movement, but most people spend the bulk of their day sitting still instead. Especially, knowledge workers sit at their desks during the day, commute by car, and relax on the couch watching TV or on their computers in the evenings.\n  An independent survey that Ergotron commissioned [1] found that nearly 70 percent of full-time American workers hate sitting, yet 86 percent are required to do it all day, every day. As a result, they are sitting on the chair for an average of 13 hours on weekdays. According to a study of weekday total sitting hours in 20 countries around the world, the median daily total sitting time for 20 countries was 300 minutes. Also, Japan and Saudi Arabia were the longest in 420 minutes and 20 countries [2].\n  Research results that the health risk is increased by sitting too much has been reported worldwide, and attention is rising. As a representative study on the risk of death, there are investigations in Australia [3] that tracked approximately 220,000 people over the age of 45 years for three years, compared to those with a sitting time of fewer than 4 hours per day over 8 hours 1.15 times, people with more than 11 hours have a 1.4 times higher risk of total mortality. According to the latest study, it has been pointed out that the sedentary life is also related to the function of the brain [4], and it is required that practical interventions aimed at reducing and replacing sedentary behavior with intermittent light intensity physical activity to help slow cognitive decline.\nRelated Work There are two major approaches to tackle this problem. One is an approach from ergonomics. Furniture makers have been developing an ergonomic chair not to get tired even if it sits for a long time [5]. However, the latest studies show that it is more important to reduce the time to sit and increase the time to move. Deborah Rohm Young’s group [6] suggests that prolonged sitting is harmful to health because sedentary behaviors usually have an little energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) or less while slow, leisurely walking or light housework uses around 2.5 METs, and vigorous to moderate physical activity uses around 3 METs or more.\n  The other approach is from user experience design to increase the standing time of people. Height adjustable table [7] enables workers to work while standing. Buckley’s group reports that standing-based office work encourages signs of attenuating post-prandial glycaemic excursion [8]. However, Baker’s research group assessed that prolonged standing might also have health and productivity impacts [9]. Data that it is not good for your health whether you are sitting too hard or too standing has been reported.\n  Apple watch [10] provides another solution. It detects periods of no move of the person wearing it and urges him/her to stand up and walk. It can announce to the user at an appropriate timing for walking based on the biometric data, but the user may not perform the actual operation or accept the advice in some cases. In summary, based on the human-centered design, these products consider how to provide comfort and a healthy posture on the premise of human physical characteristics and limitations.\n  Concept Breathing Chair offers the novel way to prevent prolonged sitting by chair breathing. When people sit for a long time, the chair breathes organically and deform into a difficult shape to sit. It leads people toward a state of standing up in a natural way. After a while, the chair quietly returns to its original state. Our approach is from ontological design, in which objects shape human beings, unlike conventional human-centered product designs mentioned in previous studies. Escobar argues “We design tools, and these tools design us back” in his book of ontological design [11]. We synthesized with and created Breathing Chair based on this nondualism concept that our individuals, materials and the world are all united and that there is no center.\n  Discussion of Shape In addition to the breathing chair, we explored some shapes of the optimal deforming chair.  \nA heating chair that makes users stand up as the temperature gets hot.  \nA folding chair that makes users stands up by changing the shape to a vertical shape.  \nAn animal chair that changes into the shape of an animal and gives a more organic impression.  \nAfter the ideation, we organized these four ideas on two axes.  \nOne axis we considered was mechanical vs. organic. Mechanical way is functional for users. However, this chair makes people sudden change, and it is not our intention to let the user feel \u0026ldquo;being forced to a machine.\u0026rdquo; Sudden mechanical change seems ruthless and irritates users. Therefore, we judged that the organic way is more appropriate in this project and wanted users to think “the chair is also a living thing and so it cannot be helped.”  \nThe other axis is state-changing vs. shape-changing. Chairs in the upper row change state like a cold state and a hot state, a shrinking state and a swelling state, whereas chairs in the lower row are only deforming from a chair to a different shape. We judged that the state-changing way is more appropriate because this way gives users more impression of living things.  \nAs a result of evaluating with the above two axes, we finally chose the idea of Breathing Chair.    \nImplementation Regarding implementation, it consists of two functions. One is measuring the time sitting. The force sensor on the seating surface measures the time since a person sits on the chair. The other is controlling breathing. In this prototype, we use the balloon, and it stretched when people were seated for a certain period.  \nAccording to Patel et al.\u0026rsquo;s research [12], it is important to walk up and walk around many times a day. Also, if you stand for two minutes every hour, lipid, blood sugar, and blood pressure will improve. Therefore, we adjusted the balloon to swell for about 2 minutes when the user continues sitting for 1 hour. The state of actual operation is shown in the following image. We confirmed that the bulging of the balloon pushes the user forward.  \nConclusion and Future Work In this paper, we propose the Breathing Chair which changes its shape to make people stand up to prevent prolonged sitting. When people sit for 1 hour, the chair breathes organically and deform into a difficult shape to sit. After 2 minutes, the chair quietly returns to its original state. It leads people toward a state of standing up in a natural way. We introduced the concept, design and running prototype.\nAs for a future iteration, there are two considerations to improve the quality of the product. One is the form itself. In this prototype, we were able to confirm that the breathing chair creates the force to make people stand up, so we would like to consider more organic shape such as a breathable fabric instead of a balloon. The other is the configuration of parameters. It is better to adjust the interval according to the usage environment, the age of the user, the use case, etc. Regarding a future application, we would like to install this product to schools and offices and to lead sedentary people to healthy lifestyles by an organic breathing chair.  \nReference  Ergotron, Inc. 2013.

When I reviewed my exploration so far, I found I am interested in creating a network in any kind of way. For example, in 2D and 4D, I tried to create a network and connect people based on background careers or question-answer conversation. Previously I said that my domain is social computing, however, social computing was still broad and it was more intriguing for me to see it from the perspective of the network.  \nActually network science covers very broad area because in the current our world, we are surrounded by bunch of networks such as hypertext, social network and transportation network and so on. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in what is networked and not networked, and what will happen if stand-alone things such as subjective feelings and body signalsare networked.  \nContext - Domain 2 Affective Interaction In 3D - 5D, I tried to implement the interaction through affective questions that can only be answered by people. Affective computing is one of the representative area of this field and researching development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. However, I want to focus on not an emotion recognition technology itself but an application of human affects as a designer.  \nCreative Precedents Penal Systems Network Penal Systems Network is a relational mapping of world’s penal systems that evoke controversy: A network map of world countries connected to juridical topics whether or not they are being exercised and how they are being exercised such as death penalty, life imprisonment, parole, indefinite sentence, and amnesty.\nContext: Make a network of domestic data  \nFeel-o-meter Fuehlometer (Feel-o-meter) is an interactive art installation that shows the mood of a city by displaying it in the form of a monumental Smiley. The system allows to read emotions out of random people’s faces. The faces are analyzed by sophisticated software (contributed by the Fraunhofer Institut). The obtained mood data are then stored on a server and processed by the smiley to visualize the emotions in real-time.\nContext: Assemble moods of the city   LAUREN. A human smart home intelligence. This project attempts to become a human version of Amazon Alexa, a smart home intelligence for people in their own homes. The artist Lauren remotely watches over the person 24\u0026frasl;7 and controls all aspects of their home. Lauren aims to be better than an AI because she can understand them as a person and anticipate their needs. The relationship that emerges falls in the ambiguous space between human-machine and human-human.\nContext: Make a network and relationship between people who do not know each other  \nelectric stimulus to face Daito Manabe experimented how might we control our face electrically.\nContext: Make a network of body signals   The Stack In The Stack, Benjamin Bratton proposes that these different genres of computation—smart grids, cloud platforms, mobile apps, smart cities, the Internet of Things, automation—can be seen not as so many species evolving on their own, but as forming a coherent whole: an accidental megastructure called The Stack that is both a computational apparatus and a new governing architecture. We are inside The Stack and it is inside of us. In an account that is both theoretical and technical, drawing on political philosophy, architectural theory, and software studies, Bratton explores six layers of The Stack: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, User. Each is mapped on its own terms and understood as a component within the larger whole built from hard and soft systems intermingling—not only computational forms but also social, human, and physical forces. This model, informed by the logic of the multilayered structure of protocol “stacks,” in which network technologies operate within a modular and vertical order, offers a comprehensive image of our emerging infrastructure and a platform for its ongoing reinvention.\nContext: Devide network into layers\n  BeeMe This Halloween scientists at MIT\u0026rsquo;s Media Lab are embarking on a massive social experiment. Called BeeMe, the project will let internet users control a real human actor, suggesting, and collectively voting on, this person\u0026rsquo;s every action. New Atlas reached out to Niccolo Pescetelli, one of the creators behind the experiment, to find out exactly what is about to happen.\nContext: Make a collective decision and control human  \nDesign Questions and Concepts so far Creative Questions In this research, I came up with the following creative questions.\n What will happen if stand-alone things such as subjective feelings and body signalsare networked?  What happens when objects are networked? Can you synthesize or disassemble it?  How might we assemble individual affects and utilize them for individuals again?  How will rewards and erroneous information affect collective decisions? How much will a person\u0026rsquo;s free will be affected by the collective will?   Concepts  Decompose network elements Networked body signal Use network as a medium of art Control virtual challacter by collective decision Visualize traffic of each layer of Stack (City, Earth and so on)  Discuss in the class Discuss with Jerry and Karen One of Jerry\u0026rsquo;s domain collective creation was similar to my domain. He was interested in collecting body signals and turning into some information, and I also curious about collecting emotions of the human. We discussed how to deal with elements of the interaction. Our common factors of interaction are people and the environment, and we debated what input and output we should use. I referred to some precedents Jerry had, and I found some interactions treated everybody equal, and the other one visualized information according to a person\u0026rsquo;s body heights. So the insight of discussion with Jerry was we can give a different look and feel according to how to handle input and output. However, Karen pointed out that we were going into discussions of implementation deeply, and we found we should discuss \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; perspective. Human augmentation, one of Karen\u0026rsquo;s domain, is also related to my domain. Our common aim is to expand the human\u0026rsquo;s perception. In discussion with Karen, I found I need to think about substantial problems from the perspective of the user and write down the question as the form of \u0026ldquo;How might we - ?\u0026rdquo; Finally, I came up with the question \u0026ldquo;How might we make a network of countries\u0026rsquo; happiness to compare with standards of happiness?\u0026rdquo; in the discussion. But I thought my question still needed strong \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo;. So I need more resarch to create future vision of network and human augmentation.\nMore Precedents Mutual Human Actuation Human actuation is the idea of using people to provide large-scale force feedback to users. The key idea is to run pairs of users at the same time and have them provide human actuation to each other.\nI came up with one question from this work: How might we connect activities which are completely different but mutualy complementary?\n  Sense-Roid: Emotional Haptic Communication with Yourself What type of emotions could be obtained if you were able to hug yourself?   Fight with myself In a Japanese geek blog, a father made a system which decreases the time of changing his child\u0026rsquo;s cloth. The problem for this father was that his child often takes time to change his cloth in the busy morning. So he projected images of the child\u0026rsquo;s changing cloth in the past and let him compete with himself in the past. In this kind of way of gamification, his child thought he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to lose to himself and became to change his cloth as quickly as possible.\nI came up with one question from this work: How might we make a network with ourselves in the past to improve ourselves?\u0026lt;  \nUpdated Questions and Concepts How might we connect activities which are completely different but mutualy complementary?  For example, if there is a person somewhere who wants to push objects and there is a person who wants to draw some object at the same time, can we connect those activities that are totally individually occurring and make mutually complementary relationships?  How might we make a network with ourselves in the past to improve ourselves?  In life, the most challenging enemy is myself.

Therefore, the client decide to launch this App in the next year cycle with considering qualitative feedback comments. Currently, the client continues to develop Android version and they are planning to release this product in 2019.\nDesign Process   Recently, a policy of electricity changed and the power grid began to be shared. A lot of competitors have been entering the electricity market and customer can choose company to look for better services. Thus C-EP must provide attractive services for users to improve its retention capability.\n  However, client is a traditional company and there is no designer in their company. So they are completely lost. To think about user, but how? This is the first design-driven project for them.\n  Therefore, I was employed as a project manager and a lead UX designer and managed an 10-person team consisting of designers, engineers and business strategists.\nI involved in the project end to end from the concept, design and build using methodologies of Design Thinking, Lean Startup and Agile Development.\n  At the beginning, the first challenge was how to define user? The first thing I did was holding 2-days IBM Design Thinking workshop with clients.\nThere were 2 meanings. One is to explore possible users, and the other is to familiarize clients with a design process because clients were not familiar with collaborating with designers and design process.\nIn 2-days workshop, we defined 3 possible user segments according to social trends in Japan. We have more and more single, dual-income and elderly households, I divided all members including IBM designers and clients into 3 teams and discussed possible users and scenarios in the sticker and paper work.\n  In this project, we decided a dual-income working mother as a primary user from perspectives of both business and user.\nAccording to our research, 49% of households are dual-income families in urban area in Japan and they will be a major segment of electricity user. And also they are actively searching for better and reasonable service, so we judged it is important to satisfy this user segment.\nAnd in the following 10 interviews with working mother, we found how hard working mother’s life is. After coming back to the home, she must do cooking and many houseworks with taking care of children. And especially we found 2 core insights we should tackle.\n  One is the problem that recent mothers often passed their smartphones to a child when they were busy and showed YouTube and animation. It causes less communication between parents and children. Also, some young mothers even lose a way how to take care of children. They feel guilty to rely on a smartphone, but they can not quit it.\nThe other insight is mothers don’t know children’s feelings and preferences well. According to our interview, even mothers who are communicating with children usually say that they do not understand children’s feelings.\n  With iterative prototyping in collaboration with C-EP members, I came up with the idea that IoT toy plays and communicates with children when parents are busy. By recording children’s daily responses and sharing these with their parents, family members can understand their hidden feelings and preferences.\n  That was a interesting idea, However, Considering the project period and budget constraints, I decided to launch the App version as the first MVP. I regarded working mothers to rely on smartphones as a new habit and turn it into positive activities.\n    \nFrom that point, we did iterative creation with build/measure/learn framework.\n    \nThe challenging part was user says unexpected comments and require functions which they personally want or there is not in the project scope. In that case, after the interview, we discussed the user comment together and prioritized in the one unified function list (namely product backlog).\n      \nNext Steps   Learnings   This is part of outcomes. I involved in the project end to end from concept, prototype and evaluation.\nThe biggest challenge in this project was some members such as client and engineer was not familiar with design process and collaboration with designer. Thus it is important to visualize designer’s mind and judge based on visualized content. In doing so, I could manage the project appropriately.\nProject Schedule    Period: 02/2017 - 01/2018 Method: User-Centered Design, Agile engineering, Lean Startup  ","date":1540353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540353600,"objectID":"4cdcec57112164531e9e68248e118528","permalink":"/project/2017_cepco/","publishdate":"2018-10-24T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/2017_cepco/","section":"project","summary":"Strategy \u0026 Design of a New Service for Family","tags":["uxui","service"],"title":"ChanoMa","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Overview   Final UI     \nVisual Design System   Design Process                           \nLearning   Project Information  Phase / Period  Concept, Design, Build 10 / 2018 (7 Day)  Team / Role  Sole Project Researcher, Designer  Method / Technology  Design Thinking   ","date":1540353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540353600,"objectID":"2cee193533a8e19424eceb7ee1beb073","permalink":"/project/2019_parsons/","publishdate":"2018-10-24T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/2019_parsons/","section":"project","summary":"Redesigned a School Event Search App","tags":["graphic","uxui"],"title":"Parsons Event App Redesign","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Overview I\u0026rsquo;m submitting this project to CHI2019 Late Breaking Work.\n  We present a Breathing Chair that changes its state and shape to prevent current sedentary lifestyle and help in shaping a healthy living habit. The Breathing chair tracks how long people have been sitting, and its surface swells physically like a mammal’s lung when people sit in the Breathing Chair for a long time. In so doing, it nudges people to stand up gently to avoid health risks of prolonged sitting. After a while, the Breathing chair quietly shrinks to its original state organically. This state-changing aspect of the Breathing Chair is almost physical reminder for people to stand up and leads them to shape a healthy lifestyle. In this paper, we describe the concept, design, and implementation method of the Breathing Chair. We also conducted the preliminary qualitative study amongst a sample of seven users and demonstrated the nudging aspect of Breathing Chair. Finally, we presented how it can be used for future applications.\nApproach and Philosophy       \nProblem Our body is designed for regular movement, but most people spend the bulk of their day sitting still instead. Especially, knowledge workers sit at their desks during the day, commute by car, and relax on the couch watching TV or on their computers in the evenings.\n  An independent survey that Ergotron commissioned [1] found that nearly 70 percent of full-time American workers hate sitting, yet 86 percent are required to do it all day, every day. As a result, they are sitting on the chair for an average of 13 hours on weekdays. According to a study of weekday total sitting hours in 20 countries around the world, the median daily total sitting time for 20 countries was 300 minutes. Also, Japan and Saudi Arabia were the longest in 420 minutes and 20 countries [2].\n  Research results that the health risk is increased by sitting too much has been reported worldwide, and attention is rising. As a representative study on the risk of death, there are investigations in Australia [3] that tracked approximately 220,000 people over the age of 45 years for three years, compared to those with a sitting time of fewer than 4 hours per day over 8 hours 1.15 times, people with more than 11 hours have a 1.4 times higher risk of total mortality. According to the latest study, it has been pointed out that the sedentary life is also related to the function of the brain [4], and it is required that practical interventions aimed at reducing and replacing sedentary behavior with intermittent light intensity physical activity to help slow cognitive decline.\nRelated Work There are two major approaches to tackle this problem. One is an approach from ergonomics. Furniture makers have been developing an ergonomic chair not to get tired even if it sits for a long time [5]. However, the latest studies show that it is more important to reduce the time to sit and increase the time to move. Deborah Rohm Young’s group [6] suggests that prolonged sitting is harmful to health because sedentary behaviors usually have an little energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) or less while slow, leisurely walking or light housework uses around 2.5 METs, and vigorous to moderate physical activity uses around 3 METs or more.\n  The other approach is from user experience design to increase the standing time of people. Height adjustable table [7] enables workers to work while standing. Buckley’s group reports that standing-based office work encourages signs of attenuating post-prandial glycaemic excursion [8]. However, Baker’s research group assessed that prolonged standing might also have health and productivity impacts [9]. Data that it is not good for your health whether you are sitting too hard or too standing has been reported.\n  Apple watch [10] provides another solution. It detects periods of no move of the person wearing it and urges him/her to stand up and walk. It can announce to the user at an appropriate timing for walking based on the biometric data, but the user may not perform the actual operation or accept the advice in some cases. In summary, based on the human-centered design, these products consider how to provide comfort and a healthy posture on the premise of human physical characteristics and limitations.\n  Concept Breathing Chair offers the novel way to prevent prolonged sitting by chair breathing. When people sit for a long time, the chair breathes organically and deform into a difficult shape to sit. It leads people toward a state of standing up in a natural way. After a while, the chair quietly returns to its original state. Our approach is from ontological design, in which objects shape human beings, unlike conventional human-centered product designs mentioned in previous studies. Escobar argues “We design tools, and these tools design us back” in his book of ontological design [11]. We synthesized with and created Breathing Chair based on this nondualism concept that our individuals, materials and the world are all united and that there is no center.\n  Discussion of Shape In addition to the breathing chair, we explored some shapes of the optimal deforming chair.  \nA heating chair that makes users stand up as the temperature gets hot.  \nA folding chair that makes users stands up by changing the shape to a vertical shape.  \nAn animal chair that changes into the shape of an animal and gives a more organic impression.  \nAfter the ideation, we organized these four ideas on two axes.  \nOne axis we considered was mechanical vs. organic. Mechanical way is functional for users. However, this chair makes people sudden change, and it is not our intention to let the user feel \u0026ldquo;being forced to a machine.\u0026rdquo; Sudden mechanical change seems ruthless and irritates users. Therefore, we judged that the organic way is more appropriate in this project and wanted users to think “the chair is also a living thing and so it cannot be helped.”  \nThe other axis is state-changing vs. shape-changing. Chairs in the upper row change state like a cold state and a hot state, a shrinking state and a swelling state, whereas chairs in the lower row are only deforming from a chair to a different shape. We judged that the state-changing way is more appropriate because this way gives users more impression of living things.  \nAs a result of evaluating with the above two axes, we finally chose the idea of Breathing Chair.    \nImplementation Regarding implementation, it consists of two functions. One is measuring the time sitting. The force sensor on the seating surface measures the time since a person sits on the chair. The other is controlling breathing. In this prototype, we use the balloon, and it stretched when people were seated for a certain period.  \nAccording to Patel et al.\u0026rsquo;s research [12], it is important to walk up and walk around many times a day. Also, if you stand for two minutes every hour, lipid, blood sugar, and blood pressure will improve. Therefore, we adjusted the balloon to swell for about 2 minutes when the user continues sitting for 1 hour. The state of actual operation is shown in the following image. We confirmed that the bulging of the balloon pushes the user forward.  \nConclusion and Future Work In this paper, we propose the Breathing Chair which changes its shape to make people stand up to prevent prolonged sitting. When people sit for 1 hour, the chair breathes organically and deform into a difficult shape to sit. After 2 minutes, the chair quietly returns to its original state. It leads people toward a state of standing up in a natural way. We introduced the concept, design and running prototype.\nAs for a future iteration, there are two considerations to improve the quality of the product. One is the form itself. In this prototype, we were able to confirm that the breathing chair creates the force to make people stand up, so we would like to consider more organic shape such as a breathable fabric instead of a balloon. The other is the configuration of parameters. It is better to adjust the interval according to the usage environment, the age of the user, the use case, etc. Regarding a future application, we would like to install this product to schools and offices and to lead sedentary people to healthy lifestyles by an organic breathing chair.  \nLearning   Reference  Ergotron, Inc. 2013.

In this class, I will create a total of four posters and two interactive visualization projects.\nIn the first half of the semester, I created three posters for specific topics such as Man-made product, Nature and Society. I learned the basic techniques of data visualization in a series of design processes from ideation, source data discovery to iterative prototyping.\nIn the second half of the semester, based on the knowledge of the first half, I will craft one more poster and two interactive projects using d3.js and other javascript libraries.  \n#1: Man-made Product I picked up the traditional Japanese costume called Junihitoe to introduce Japanese culture, and expressed characteristic information such as being 12 layers of kimono and being very heavy.\nUsing the grid system, I arranged the information so that the viewer\u0026rsquo;s eyes flow naturally from the image of the impressive kimono in the center to the surrounding information.  \n#2: Nature I picked up the solar eclipse forecast because I was interested in astronomy and wanted to draw a planetary arc using the earth as a canvas. I expressed the mechanism of the eclipse and where the total eclipse, annular eclipse and hybrid eclipse will occur from 2019 to 2031.\nI was struggled how to arrange information on location and date information of eclipse. In the iteration 1, I tried the idea of displaying the date information on the location of the eclipse. However, after receiving the feedback that the information is complicated, I decided to display the information of the place and the information of the date separately in the iteration 2.  \n#3: Society I wanted to compare countries in the world in the field of information, so I found the worldwide investigation data of mobile data consumption per SIM per Month in 2018. I draw the ranking of mobile data usage all over the world.\nI wanted to experiment a new method, so I tried the 2.5D expression. While continuing trial and error, I came up with the idea of using the binary number as a bar chart, and finally expressed the amount of data of each country in binary representation such as 14Gigabytes is represented as 1101000010011101110000110000000000 in binary.  \nMy Methodology 1: Using the structural system   My Methodology 2: Inspiration from great works   My Methodology 3: Following Design Thinking Process   Reference Complications and Adjacencies: An Organizing Logic for Information Graphics\nProject Information  Phase / Period  Concept, Design, Build 1 / 2019 - 5 / 2019  Team / Role  Sole Project Researcher, Designer  Method / Technology  Design Thinking   ","date":1540180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540180800,"objectID":"e478411627f0d060500c75aa94ac9399","permalink":"/project/2019_viz/","publishdate":"2018-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/2019_viz/","section":"project","summary":"Designed posters which visualizes various data","tags":["graphic"],"title":"Information Aesthetics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Overview I personally tried to redesign MTA services because NYC subway riding experience is uncomfortable for me; dirty platform, unexpected stop, morning/evening rush and so on. I conducted the entire design process to specify inconvenient element of the subway and improve services of MTA.\nMy Role I conducted the whole design process from interviewing with users, defining problem, ideation, prototyping and evaluation.\nBackground Current research (source) shows that subway and bus ridership has declined while ridership through ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber has increased. App-based services are based on a great UX and are increasing their users dramatically.\nTherefore, to increase a retention rate, MTA needs to provide the user-centered service for the purpose of getting access easily to the metro, on time, without having a bad experience.\n Data: Transportation Trends in NYC   From interviewing with real users, it turned out that NYC commuters sometimes have a frustration that they want to catch a train but cannot because they don\u0026rsquo;t have enough money in the metro card. In this moment, they have to go back to a ticket vending machine and wait in a long line to refill your card. This is really frustrating and painful experience.\n  To solve this problem, I developed the idea of smart metrocard which enables users to refill the money anytime and anywhere. Subway users can refill money through the App and enter the platform without using a ticket vending machine.\n Smart Metrocard   This proposal is a little bit radical because the physical metrocard also need to be intelligent in order to reflect real-time refilling money from the App. However, this smart metrocard infrastructure is adopted by many countries such as Germany, France and Japan, and they don’t have a frustration of purchasing train tickets. \nResult In this design challenge, I conducted the user interview using the invision mockup, basic function is accepted by the user and we can plan a next iteration.  \nDesign Process New York city commuters are primary user group and travelers are second user group because they are the biggest user groups.\nFrom my research, there are 1.5 million daily-use commuters in NYC and over 60 million temporary-use traveller in a year. Also, they’re creating over $500M per month in total. They account for the majority of MTA\u0026rsquo;s revenue.  \nInterviewing with a real user and confirming our assumption at the beginning is the fastest way to define problems.\nI conducted interviews with 3 friends of mine. 2 of them are commuters and other 1 is traveller. I confirmed their process to use the subway and extracted their pain points from this interview.\nI found commuters have frustration especially in rush hour. They hate time consuming to make a line to refill a metrocard and crowded train. Also, travellers have a trouble to sightseeing. They feel the entrance is narrow for big suitcase, time is not accurate and platform is dirty.\nFinally, I converged the pain points and categorized 3 main frustration area from the interview. This is the problem related to ticket machines, platform and train schedule. These areas needs to be solved.\n        \nBased on the specified pain points and directions, I conducted the brainstorming and created bold ideas. I came up with 10 following ideas.\n Touch \u0026amp; Go by smartphone Gateless entry Fingerprint entry Refill using App Free wifi spot Library in the platform Bigger entrance visualize maintenance status visualize realtime train operation status visualize real train location on the map            --\nI think the prioritization is the most important part because we must decide the solution and discard other solutions in this timing.\nIn this time, I used the prioritization grid which I used in my IBM career. This grid has 2 axis. One is desirability for the user and the other is feasibility in terms of technology and business. Using this 2 axis, we can evaluate the idea from design, business and technology.\n  I arranged the idea using this chart and decided to pick up the idea that is in the No-Brainer area. I finally chose the \u0026ldquo;Refill using App\u0026rdquo; idea because there is other competitors in the other idea in the No-Brainer area.\n  After defining the solution, I moved to the implementation phase. I drew the storyboard, content map and wireframes. My policy is drawing an experience in the storyboard. It should not be functional because it verifies the experience we\u0026rsquo;re thinking. For me, the prototype is a work to improve the resolution from 1 shot idea, 6 shots storyboards, to an interactive mockup.      \nSolution Smart Metrocard App    After prototyping, I conducted the user interview using the invision mockup because of the limited timeline. However, project success is measured by both quantitative and qualitative to judge properly.\nIn terms of quantitative perspective, we can test the time to refill money via App compared with making a line in front of a vending machine. We need to evaluate practical effects of the project using quantitative data. Also, in terms of qualitative measure, user interview should be conducted in the evaluation stage. I can confirm more emotional effects for the user.   Learning When I work in a project, I think the following two part is the most important.\nOne is defining the right problem because it is meaningless to solve the wrong problem. In this project, I conducted several user interviews to explore the problem and verify our assumption. Going out of the office and listening to the voice of real users is the start point of the project.\nThe other is making as soon as possible trying multiple iterations. We cannot deliver a perfect product in the first iteration. We need to continue quick prototype and validate the experience in each time. In this project, I couldn’t take enough time to continue iterative cycles because of the limited timeline, but I need to manage at least 2 prototyping cycles to improve the final quality.\nDesign Timeline    Project Type  Private | UX Design Challenge  Phase / Period  Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test 10 / 2018 (40h)  Team  Sole Project  Method / Technology  User-Centered Design Target Device: iOS App   ","date":1540180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540180800,"objectID":"b2b63211c49bf15e146822e39ab85c4d","permalink":"/tmp/2018_mta/","publishdate":"2018-10-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tmp/2018_mta/","section":"tmp","summary":"UX Design Challenge\nPersonal Project | iOS App | 1 Week","tags":["uxui"],"title":"MTA Smart Metrocard","type":"tmp"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Overview I had the opportunity to join the Research Methods in Interaction Design course at the School of Visual Arts. Our instructor Jodi Leo, Executive Director of User Experience at Critical Mass, led us to collaborate with the Research team at Uber to optimize efficiency for Uber drivers during the pick up at the JFK airport.\nMy Role I conducted interviews with Uber drivers, conducted secondary research, developed personas, project management, synthesis, concept/use case design, and designed the presentation narrative.  \nProblem We called with Sam Eldersveld, Director of Operations Research at Uber, and we learned that Uber thought the perfect pickup is the most important factor of the User Experience. The moment of pickup is when the driver and the rider meet for the first time. Both drivers and riders are nervous and frustrating in this moment because drivers want to finish the work without trouble and riders want to get to the destination quickly. If the entrance of this interaction is uncomfortable, the subsequent ride experience will also be unpleasant.\n Interview Material   Field Research We conducted our field research at JFK airport. It is one of the places where perfect pickup is difficult because of crowed cars and peoples, complicated terminal numbers and exits.\n Field Research and Interview with the Driver   We interviewed with a real driver how to do his work usually. We negotiated an untraditional ride: circling around the JFK airport for a 20 minute interview session.\nIn the interview, we confirmed that he had a problem to pick up a rider in the airport. Our driver told that he had a mistake that he picked up the wrong person who has a same first name because this passenger was so in a hurry. Also, he had a language problem because sometimes people who cannot speak English ride especially in the airport. We understood how difficult to pick up a right person perfectly.\nAlso, we used AEIOU (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users) templates as a framework to gather notable findings and we recorded all interactions and experiences we had.\n  According to the field research, the problem is that Uber drivers have a language problem in the airport ride because sometimes passengers cannot speak English. This causes unjustifiable low ratings of drivers.\nDefine Problem After the interview, we debriefed our findings and designed a persona based on our talk with the driver. Just to note, there are other personas within the Uber driver community (young, single, female, temporary, etc). In the context of perfecting the pickup at JFK airport, solutions should be applied to all Uber drivers.\n      From gained insights of field research, we developed a user flow and mockup screens.\nExplore Solution We met after classes to conduct brainstorming and create solution. A few themes we began to build upon:\n The driver has a language problem when the passenger cannot speak English The driver sometimes cannot recognize the accurate pickup location    After the ideation, we began to segment the Uber driver journey to visualize the complete end to end experience and look for opportunities to optimize the pickup process. We also designed a journey map for the passenger side as well.\n   To-Be User Journey Map   Prototype: Perfecting the Pickup regardless of language         \nResult Our team pitched our research and mockups to the class and really valuable feedback around the viability of our solutions. The feedback to focus on the functionality and flow of the driver interface is reflected in the iterations that have been made on this document.    \nLearning I think user interview needs not just a talking skill but a well-prepared strategy. To have a good preparation enables us to extract a good insight from user.\nIn this class, the professor told us these strategies of interview. For example, we should go to interview with at least 3 people and devided the role separately. One focus on the interview, another one focus on the minutes, and the final one focus on recording. It means interviewing is not only just a talking, but also a strategic activity. Another strategy is to prepare questions beforehand. To think about why we ask this question and what we want to extract is the most important part of the interview. Without these thinkings, our interview will be lost the way.\nDesign Timeline    Project Type  Academic Company: Uber Instructor: Jodi Leo, VP of Product Design at CapTap Class: Research Methods  Team with  Sandra Gatica Morales, Colleen Brogan  Method / Technology  User-Centered Design Target Device: Mobile  Tasks  Interviews, User research, UX Design, Acquisition design  Output  Sketches ( design iterations and user flows) Interview Footage, Synthesis, and Findings User Acquisition research Design and functionality recommendations proposal deck Final assets (presentation poster board)   ","date":1540094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540094400,"objectID":"2991405f954e3bb35f4e0006e875cbc1","permalink":"/project/2015_uber/","publishdate":"2018-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/2015_uber/","section":"project","summary":"Improvement of a Service","tags":["uxui"],"title":"UBER UX RESEARCH AND DESIGN","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Masaki is an interaction and service designer based in NY.

As the development of technology, we can find many answers online within just a second. Have we ever wondered how the other people think about the same question? Have we ever wondered what it looks like after collecting different opinions together?\n  Concept Convert people\u0026rsquo;s emotions into collective mood of the group/community   Design Decision  What kind of question is appropriate?  Use an open question to confirm the difference between a collective opinion and a subjective opinion and to ask a more social question.  How to answer the question?  Decide to use easy yes/no question to create a first running mockup quickly. Types of quesitions and responding formats can be changed later.  How to visualize answers?  More intuitive way is appropriate such as color or size. Decided to explore a tangible format because data visualization on the screen is being implemented in many cases. Sought a different perspective by outputting data that is usually visualized visually to different sensory such as taste.  Is there a business impact?  Realize the experience of tasting a mood of the day and expect commercialization as a drink of the \u0026ldquo;mood\u0026rdquo;.   Physical Prototype Using arduino and processing, I implemented the physical prototype.  \nEvaluation   Future Iteration I am planning to improve it using actual juice and demonstration in public spaces and facilities.\n Platform to collect public opinion  It can be used as a platform to visualize the current mood of cities, facilities and communities.

An umbrella or parasol is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight. It is said that an umbrella has been used about 4000 years ago and remains in sculptures such as Egypt, Persia, and mural paintings. In many regions, umbrellas have developed to protect the king from sunlight, so they have long been a luxury item, a symbol of wealth and power.  \nThe umbrella of the current structure was developed as a parasol in the 18th century, and initially, it was a woman\u0026rsquo;s belongings. On rainy days the man was wet without a habit of having an umbrella, but eventually, the umbrella also spread to men. The context of the umbrella changes with the times and it is still used worldwide as an essential item of rain today.   Paris Street; Rainy Weather, by Gustave Caillebotte (1877)\nAs an interface between people and rain, an umbrella has a very long history. Although the context to be used has changed, the function and design almost unchanged for thousands of years. The shape of umbrella affords us to open, and I think that it is a complete form as a product.\nHowever, umbrellas have risks of being stolen or forgotten, hand clogging, wind weakness, etc. I think that there is a possibility of innovation using emerging technology. For example, an umbrella capable of tracking position information and a drone umbrella is undergoing demonstration experiments.  \nHowever, I focused on a project named \u0026ldquo;Song of Raindrop\u0026rdquo; that uses Arduino to convert energy when rain hits an umbrella into music.  \nIt is wonderful that this project is not for the current problem solving, it makes the rainy day more pleasant and also makes the context of rainy days change poetically. I would like to refer to this \u0026ldquo;augmented rainy day\u0026rdquo; idea regarding changing the context and making natural phenomena more interactive.\n","date":1535860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535860800,"objectID":"25782e79df54bd56b139370500a3af9c","permalink":"/ms1/interface/","publishdate":"2018-09-02T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/ms1/interface/","section":"ms1","summary":"Critique for the umbrella","tags":null,"title":"Interface Critique","type":"ms1"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" XHuman: Educational Headset for transhumans to Experience “Human” in 2075 XHuman is an educational headset for transhumans who inplants superintelligence into their left brain which works for language, memory, calculation.

Users can operate from the rear side of the screen while seeing both displayed images and their fingers. This feature resolves a finger occlusion problem. Additionally, it also works for multiple users. Two users can share an identical display from both sides and control displayed objects at one time. This feature will apply to a collaborative work and an entertainment application.\nInspiration: What if we can display information on a transparent surface? Direct-touch input enables intuitive operation, and touch panels have been mounted on various devices. However, finger occlusion becomes one of the problems when a user touches the display from the front side. Here, inspired from SF movies, one idea to solve this problem is to use \u0026ldquo;transparent\u0026rdquo; display. Additionally, we can imagine various scenarios if we can display information on a transparent surface.  \nConcept: Interaction from the rear side of the display With transparent surface users can operate from the rear side of the screen while seeing both displayed images and their fingers. This feature resolves a finger occlusion problem. Additionally, this feature works for multiple users. Two users can share an identical display from both sides and control displayed objects at one time. It will apply to a collaborative work and an entertainment application.  \nLearning: Research through Design During this period, I developed a strong belief that an effective interchange between theory and practice is essential to advancing society. I obtained transdisciplinary feedback from both academia and the public on my academic poster and demonstrations for LimpiDual Touch, which revealed to me that visualized emerging technologies harbored a powerful ability to stimulate user imagination. I was especially intrigued by new questions raised by viewers and attendees, such as whether all future devices would utilize rear side input, or how the user experience would change if glass were replaced by a transparent display. To me, these inquiries were more important than new ideas for practical applications for the technology.  \nDiscourse Research and Problem Finding There have been several research projects that offer interactions by touching the rear surface of the device [Sugimoto and Hiroki 2006], [Wigdor et al. 2007]. However, the former prevents the user from seeing his hands; this sets up a new occlusion problem. As for the latter, the system size becomes large since a camera has to be attached outside the display. Our LimpiDual Touch has a simple hardware setting that allows the user to see his hands using an optically limpid display.\n WIGDOR, D., FORLINES, C., BAUDISCH, P., BARNWELL, J., SHEN, C. 2007. LucidTouch: A See-Through Mobile Device In Proceedings of UIST 2007, 269–278. SUGIMOTO, M. AND HIROKI, K., 2006. HybridTouch: An Intuitive Manipulation Technique for PDAs Using Their Front and Rear Surfaces In Proceedings of MobileHCI, 137–140.    System Design We present the LimpiDual Touch, which enables dual-sided touch sensing while seeing user’s fingers optically. The following chart shows the system design of LimpiDual Touch. To achieve our purpose, we focused on the Teraoka “ELEXY”, non-organic transparent EL display (the degree of transparency is 80%). The ELEXY has 256 x 120 pixels and displays 4 levels of brightness in umber color.\nWe attached two transparent touch panels (Datamate, the degree of transparency is 80%) on both sides of it, and these three panels are well calibrated. Using this system, the user can control displayed images from the rear side as well as the front side of the display. LimpiDual Touch has following features.\n The user can control information from the rear side of the display while optically seeing both the displayed images and their fingers. This characteristic can avoid the occlusion problem and brings new interactions by using both sides of the display. The LimpiDual Touch also works effectively for multiple users. More than two users can share the identical display and simultaneously control displayed objects from both sides of without the fingers colliding.    Application Prototyping We have created many idea sketches and developed two types of applications. One is for single user and the other is for two or more users facing across the display.\n  For single user, we implemented an application of layer manipulation. Information of mountains, regions and cities are overlaid on the map. The user can change the order of the layers by touching each side of the display, and select displayed additional information by touching specific points from the rear side of the display.\nFor multiple users, we implemented a “Tic-Tac-Toe” game application. In this application, players alternatively put marks (O or X) on a 3 x 3 grid. Two users can share the identical display while looking at the gestures or expressions each other. Such interactions between multiple users can be used for entertainment.\n  Development and Evaluation I demonstrated this sytem in public exhibitions and received many feedbacks from public.\nFuture work will be focused on improving mobility and expanding applications. It would be also important to evaluate utility and to design a good size of the system.\n  Result: Honored by ACM SIGGRAPH I’ve proposed the emerging interactive transparent display named ‘‘LimpiDual Touch’’. Also, I’ve proved both-sided input had significant difference compared to front-side input as for the accuracy of touch input. In 2008, LimpiDual Touch was selected for ACM SIGGRAPH Student Research Competition and won the Japan Good Design Award.\nAwards \u0026amp; Honors  Selected for ACM SIGGRAPH Student Research Competition, 2008.

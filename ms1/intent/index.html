<h4 id="context-domain-1">Context - Domain 1</h4>

<h2 id="network-science">Network Science</h2>

<p>The first domain I want to research is Network Science. When I reviewed my exploration so far, I found I am interested in creating a network in any kind of way. For example, in 2D and 4D, I tried to create a network and connect people based on background careers or question-answer conversation. Previously I said that my domain is social computing, however, social computing was still broad and it was more intriguing for me to see it from the perspective of the network.



<figure>

</figure></p>

<p>Actually network science covers very broad area because in the current our world, we are surrounded by bunch of networks such as hypertext, social network and transportation network and so on. I&rsquo;m interested in what is networked and not networked, and what will happen if stand-alone things such as subjective feelings and body signalsare networked.

<h4 id="context-domain-2">Context - Domain 2</h4>

<h2 id="affective-interaction">Affective Interaction</h2>

<p>In 3D - 5D, I tried to implement the interaction through affective questions that can only be answered by people. Affective computing is one of the representative area of this field and researching development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. However, I want to focus on not an emotion recognition technology itself but an application of human affects as a designer.

<p>Penal Systems Network is a relational mapping of world’s penal systems that evoke controversy: A network map of world countries connected to juridical topics whether or not they are being exercised and how they are being exercised such as death penalty, life imprisonment, parole, indefinite sentence, and amnesty.</p>

<h2 id="feel-o-meter">Feel-o-meter</h2>

<p>Fuehlometer (Feel-o-meter) is an interactive art installation that shows the mood of a city by displaying it in the form of a monumental Smiley. The system allows to read emotions out of random people’s faces. The faces are analyzed by sophisticated software (contributed by the Fraunhofer Institut). The obtained mood data are then stored on a server and processed by the smiley to visualize the emotions in real-time.</p>

<h2 id="lauren-a-human-smart-home-intelligence">LAUREN. A human smart home intelligence.</h2>

<p>This project attempts to become a human version of Amazon Alexa, a smart home intelligence for people in their own homes. The artist Lauren remotely watches over the person <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> and controls all aspects of their home. Lauren aims to be better than an AI because she can understand them as a person and anticipate their needs. The relationship that emerges falls in the ambiguous space between human-machine and human-human.</p>

<h2 id="the-stack">The Stack</h2>

<p>In The Stack, Benjamin Bratton proposes that these different genres of computation—smart grids, cloud platforms, mobile apps, smart cities, the Internet of Things, automation—can be seen not as so many species evolving on their own, but as forming a coherent whole: an accidental megastructure called The Stack that is both a computational apparatus and a new governing architecture. We are inside The Stack and it is inside of us. In an account that is both theoretical and technical, drawing on political philosophy, architectural theory, and software studies, Bratton explores six layers of The Stack: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, User. Each is mapped on its own terms and understood as a component within the larger whole built from hard and soft systems intermingling—not only computational forms but also social, human, and physical forces. This model, informed by the logic of the multilayered structure of protocol “stacks,” in which network technologies operate within a modular and vertical order, offers a comprehensive image of our emerging infrastructure and a platform for its ongoing reinvention.</p>

<h2 id="beeme">BeeMe</h2>

<p>This Halloween scientists at MIT&rsquo;s Media Lab are embarking on a massive social experiment. Called BeeMe, the project will let internet users control a real human actor, suggesting, and collectively voting on, this person&rsquo;s every action. New Atlas reached out to Niccolo Pescetelli, one of the creators behind the experiment, to find out exactly what is about to happen.</p>

<h4 id="design-questions-and-concepts-so-far">Design Questions and Concepts so far</h4>

<h2 id="creative-questions">Creative Questions</h2>

<p>In this research, I came up with the following creative questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>What will happen if stand-alone things such as subjective feelings and body signalsare networked?

<ul>
<li>What happens when objects are networked? Can you synthesize or disassemble it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How might we assemble individual affects and utilize them for individuals again?

<ul>
<li>How will rewards and erroneous information affect collective decisions?</li>
<li>How much will a person&rsquo;s free will be affected by the collective will?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Decompose network elements</li>
<li>Networked body signal</li>
<li>Use network as a medium of art</li>
<li>Control virtual challacter by collective decision</li>
<li>Visualize traffic of each layer of Stack (City, Earth and so on)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="discuss-in-the-class">Discuss in the class</h4>

<h2 id="discuss-with-jerry-and-karen">Discuss with Jerry and Karen</h2>

<p>One of Jerry&rsquo;s domain collective creation was similar to my domain. He was interested in collecting body signals and turning into some information, and I also curious about collecting emotions of the human. We discussed how to deal with elements of the interaction. Our common factors of interaction are people and the environment, and we debated what input and output we should use. I referred to some precedents Jerry had, and I found some interactions treated everybody equal, and the other one visualized information according to a person&rsquo;s body heights. So the insight of discussion with Jerry was we can give a different look and feel according to how to handle input and output.
However, Karen pointed out that we were going into discussions of implementation deeply, and we found we should discuss &ldquo;why&rdquo; perspective. Human augmentation, one of Karen&rsquo;s domain, is also related to my domain. Our common aim is to expand the human&rsquo;s perception. In discussion with Karen, I found I need to think about substantial problems from the perspective of the user and write down the question as the form of &ldquo;How might we - ?&rdquo;
Finally, I came up with the question &ldquo;How might we make a network of countries&rsquo; happiness to compare with standards of happiness?&rdquo; in the discussion. But I thought my question still needed strong &ldquo;why&rdquo;. So I need more resarch to create future vision of network and human augmentation.</p>

<h2 id="mutual-human-actuation">Mutual Human Actuation</h2>

<p>Human actuation is the idea of using people to provide large-scale force feedback to users. The key idea is to run pairs of users at the same time and have them provide human actuation to each other.</p>

<p>I came up with one question from this work: How might we connect activities which are completely different but mutualy complementary?</p>

<h2 id="fight-with-myself">Fight with myself</h2>

<p>In a Japanese geek blog, a father made a system which decreases the time of changing his child&rsquo;s cloth. The problem for this father was that his child often takes time to change his cloth in the busy morning. So he projected images of the child&rsquo;s changing cloth in the past and let him compete with himself in the past. In this kind of way of gamification, his child thought he didn&rsquo;t want to lose to himself and became to change his cloth as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I came up with one question from this work: How might we make a network with ourselves in the past to improve ourselves?&lt;

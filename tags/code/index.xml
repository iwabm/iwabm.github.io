      <description>-- LIMPIDUAL TOUCH Interaction Design | 2009, Academic Work  Overview Designed and proposed interactive limpid display with dual-sided touch sensing.   I’ve proposed the emerging interactive transparent display named ‘‘LimpiDual Touch’’. Users can operate from the rear side of the screen while seeing both displayed images and their fingers. This feature resolves a finger occlusion problem. Additionally, LimpiDual Touch also works for multiple users. Two users can share an identical display from both sides and control displayed objects at one time.</description>

      <description>2016, Photography After 100 years, which landscapes will we take? Will photography be still alive?
This is a project that comes from questions.
This is a speculative and experimental imagination for our future 22nd century.
This is the normal way of life in the 22nd century. Children is playing in a &#34;virtual forest&#34;.
Are these images our future dreamed life?
 This is the normal way of life in the 22nd century.</description>

      <description>2015, Photography Sometimes I feel as if I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a place that I have visited before.
When I had this feeling in Tokyo and Osaka, which are representative cities of the East and West of Japan, I tried to find what made me feel that way.
This is my way to test my feeling of deja vu and also of seeking out something unique in these cities.

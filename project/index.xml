      <description>Overview Chubu Electric Power(C-EP) supplies electricity to 10 million households in Japan. ChanoMa (means &amp;ldquo;Living Room&amp;rdquo;) is a service for a dual-income households with a small children among their customers to tighten family bonds.
  This image is part of the project’s final design that I delivered to the client. A special feature of using Chanoma is that App plays and communicates with children when parents are busy. By recording children&amp;rsquo;s daily responses and sharing these with their parents, family members can understand their hidden feelings and preferences.</description>

      <description>Project Overview Current research (source) shows that subway and bus ridership has declined while ridership through ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber has increased. App-based services are based on a great UX and are increasing their users dramatically.
Therefore, to increase a retention rate, MTA needs to provide the user-centered service for the purpose of getting access easily to the metro, on time, without having a bad experience.
 Data: Transportation Trends in NYC   From interviewing with real users, it turned out that NYC commuters sometimes have a frustration that they want to catch a train but cannot because they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough money in the metro card.</description>

      <description>Project Overview We called with Sam Eldersveld, Director of Operations Research at Uber, and we learned that Uber thought the perfect pickup is the most important factor of the User Experience. The moment of pickup is when the driver and the rider meet for the first time. Both drivers and riders are nervous and frustrating in this moment because drivers want to finish the work without trouble and riders want to get to the destination quickly.</description>

      <description>Demo Video   Problem Our body is designed for regular movement, but most people spend the bulk of their day sitting still instead. Especially, knowledge workers sit at their desks during the day, commute by car, and relax on the couch watching TV or on their computers in the evenings.
  An independent survey that Ergotron commissioned [1] found that nearly 70 percent of full-time American workers hate sitting, yet 86 percent are required to do it all day, every day.</description>

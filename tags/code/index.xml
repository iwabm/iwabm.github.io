      <description>Project Overview I&amp;rsquo;m submitting this project to ACM SIGGRAPH 2019 Posters.
  We present a Breathing Chair that changes its state and shape to prevent current sedentary lifestyle and help in shaping a healthy living habit. The Breathing chair tracks how long people have been sitting, and its surface swells physically like a mammal’s lung when people sit in the Breathing Chair for a long time. In so doing, it nudges people to stand up gently to avoid health risks of prolonged sitting.</description>

      <description>Overview I&amp;rsquo;m taking the class of &amp;ldquo;Data Visualization and Information Aesthetics&amp;rdquo; at Parsons School of Design. In this class, I will create a total of four posters and two interactive visualization projects.
In the first half of the semester, I created three posters for specific topics such as Man-made product, Nature and Society. I learned the basic techniques of data visualization in a series of design processes from ideation, source data discovery to iterative prototyping.</description>

      <description>Project Overview   Collective Juice is a physical product that collects different user&amp;rsquo;s emotions and tone together to reveal and visualizes the “mood” of the group/community.
Objective How might we collect responses to questions that can only be answered by humans? As the development of technology, we can find many answers online within just a second. Have we ever wondered how the other people think about the same question?</description>

      <description>#1: Immersive Music Visualizer   I imagined the space-trip and a scene in which we encountered unknown objects. I coded a sound visualizer which enables music experience more immersive in the 3D space.
When the user upload the music, this visualizer converts three music parameters into visualized elements. Users can manipulate the viewpoint in the 3D space.
 BPM (Beats Per Minutre) -&amp;gt; Velocity of balls Sound Volume -&amp;gt; Dynamics of balls and the plane Length of Music -&amp;gt; The number of random colored balls    Project Information  Phase / Period  Concept, Design, Build 10 / 2018 (1 Day)  Team / Role  Sole Project Maker, Coder  Method / Technology  Iterative coding html5, css3, javascript, three.</description>

      <description>Project Overview    LimpiDual Touch is the emerging interactive transparent display. Users can operate from the rear side of the screen while seeing both displayed images and their fingers. This feature resolves a finger occlusion problem. Additionally, it also works for multiple users. Two users can share an identical display from both sides and control displayed objects at one time. This feature will apply to a collaborative work and an entertainment application.</description>

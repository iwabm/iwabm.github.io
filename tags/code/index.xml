      <description>Project Overview   We present a Breathing Chair that changes its state and shape to prevent current sedentary lifestyle and help in shaping a healthy living habit. The Breathing chair tracks how long people have been sitting, and its surface swells physically like a mammal’s lung when people sit in the Breathing Chair for a long time. In so doing, it nudges people to stand up gently to avoid health risks of prolonged sitting.</description>

      <description>Project Overview   Collective Juice is a physical product that collects different user&amp;rsquo;s emotions and tone together to reveal and visualizes the “mood” of the group/community.
Objective How might we collect responses to questions that can only be answered by humans? As the development of technology, we can find many answers online within just a second. Have we ever wondered how the other people think about the same question?</description>

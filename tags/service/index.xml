      <description>Overview Chubu Electric Power(C-EP) supplies electricity to 10 million households in Japan. ChanoMa (means &amp;ldquo;Living Room&amp;rdquo;) is a service for a dual-income households with a small children among their customers to tighten family bonds.
  This image is part of the projectâ€™s final design that I delivered to the client. A special feature of using Chanoma is that App plays and communicates with children when parents are busy. By recording children&amp;rsquo;s daily responses and sharing these with their parents, family members can understand their hidden feelings and preferences.</description>

<h3 id="context-domain-1">Context - Domain 1</h3>

<h2 id="network-science">Network Science</h2>

<p>The first domain I want to research is Network Science. When I reviewed my exploration so far, I found I am interested in creating a network in any kind of way. For example, in 2D and 4D, I tried to create a network and connect people based on background careers or question-answer conversation. Previously I said that my domain is social computing, however, social computing was still broad and it was more intriguing for me to see it from the perspective of the network.

<figure class="img-ingrid">
    
        <img src="/img/pf/ms1/Intent/1.png" alt="RDT1" />
    
    
</figure>
</p>

<p>Actually network science covers very broad area because in the current our world, we are surrounded by bunch of networks such as hypertext, social network and transportation network and so on. I&rsquo;m interested in what is networked and not networked, and what will happen if stand-alone things such as subjective feelings and body signalsare networked.

<h3 id="context-domain-2">Context - Domain 2</h3>

<h2 id="affective-interaction">Affective Interaction</h2>

<p>In 3D - 5D, I tried to implement the interaction through affective questions that can only be answered by people. Affective computing is one of the representative area of this field and researching development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. However, I want to focus on not an emotion recognition technology itself but an application of human affects as a designer.

The obtained mood data are then stored on a server and processed by the smiley to visualize the emotions in real-time.</p>

<h2 id="the-stack">The Stack</h2>

<div class="single-overview-grid">
    <div class="overview1-container">
        <p>In The Stack, Benjamin Bratton proposes that these different genres of computation—smart grids, cloud platforms, mobile apps, smart cities, the Internet of Things, automation—can be seen not as so many species evolving on their own, but as forming a coherent whole: an accidental megastructure called The Stack that is both a computational apparatus and a new governing architecture. We are inside The Stack and it is inside of us. In an account that is both theoretical and technical, drawing on political philosophy, architectural theory, and software studies, Bratton explores six layers of The Stack: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, User. Each is mapped on its own terms and understood as a component within the larger whole built from hard and soft systems intermingling—not only computational forms but also social, human, and physical forces. This model, informed by the logic of the multilayered structure of protocol “stacks,” in which network technologies operate within a modular and vertical order, offers a comprehensive image of our emerging infrastructure and a platform for its ongoing reinvention. </p>

<h2 id="creative-questions">Creative Questions</h2>

<p>In this research, I came up with the following creative questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>What will happen if stand-alone things such as subjective feelings and body signalsare networked?

<ul>
<li>What happens when objects are networked? Can you synthesize or disassemble it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How might we assemble individual affects and utilize them for individuals again?

<ul>
<li>How will rewards and erroneous information affect collective decisions?</li>
<li>How much will a person&rsquo;s free will be affected by the collective will?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Decompose network elements</li>
<li>Networked body signal</li>
<li>Use network as a medium of art</li>
<li>Control virtual challacter by collective decision</li>
<li>Visualize traffic of each layer of Stack (City, Earth and so on)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="discuss-in-the-class">Discuss in the class</h3>

<h2 id="discuss-with-jerry-and-karen">Discuss with Jerry and Karen</h2>

<p>One of Jerry&rsquo;s domain collective creation was similar to my domain. He was interested in collecting body signals and turning into some information, and I also curious about collecting emotions of the human. We discussed how to deal with elements of the interaction. Our common factors of interaction are people and the environment, and we debated what input and output we should use. I referred to some precedents Jerry had, and I found some interactions treated everybody equal, and the other one visualized information according to a person&rsquo;s body heights. So the insight of discussion with Jerry was we can give a different look and feel according to how to handle input and output.
However, Karen pointed out that we were going into discussions of implementation deeply, and we found we should discuss &ldquo;why&rdquo; perspective. Human augmentation, one of Karen&rsquo;s domain, is also related to my domain. Our common aim is to expand the human&rsquo;s perception. In discussion with Karen, I found I need to think about substantial problems from the perspective of the user and write down the question as the form of &ldquo;How might we - ?&rdquo;
Finally, I came up with the question &ldquo;How might we make a network of countries&rsquo; happiness to compare with standards of happiness?&rdquo; in the discussion. But I thought my question still needed strong &ldquo;why&rdquo;. So I need more resarch to create future vision of network and human augmentation.</p>

        <p>In a Japanese geek blog, a father made a system which decreases the time of changing his child's cloth. The problem for this father was that his child often takes time to change his cloth in the busy morning. So he projected images of the child's changing cloth in the past and let him compete with himself in the past. In this kind of way of gamification, his child thought he didn't want to lose to himself and became to change his cloth as quickly as possible.</p>

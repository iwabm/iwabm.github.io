      <description>COLLECTIVE JUICE Interaction Design | 2018, Academic Work  Objective What is the question that can only be answered by humans during the AI era? Everyday we are googling many questions and we can get answer immediately. Also, recently AI can answer more and more sophisticated questions. However, I think still there are things that can only be answered by people such as fuzzy, real-time and people-oriented questions. I would like to focus on and play with these types of questions.</description>

Direct-touch input enables intuitive operation, and touch panels have been mounted on various devices. However, finger occlusion becomes one of the problems when a user touches the display from the front side. Here, inspired from SF movies, one idea to solve this problem is to use &amp;ldquo;transparent&amp;rdquo; display. Additionally, we can imagine various scenarios if we can display information on a transparent surface.</description>

<h5 id="overview">Overview</h5>

<p>Chubu Electric Power(C-EP) supplies electricity to 10 million households in Japan. The goal of this project was to make C-EPâ€™s brand an essential part of family life with a user-centered product and improve its retention rate.</p>

<p>ChanoMa (means &ldquo;Living Room&rdquo;) is a <b>service for a dual-income households with a small children</b> to tighten family bonds. We decided a dual-income working mother as a primary user because 49% of households are dual-income families in urban area in Japan.</p>




<figure>

<img src="img/Slide14.png" />


</figure>

<p>A special feature of using ChanoMa is that App plays and communicates with children when parents are busy.</p>

<p>According to many interviews with working mothers, my team found how hard working parents&rsquo; life and they are the busiest with cooking and houseworks for 30 minutes since they came home. ChanoMa plays with children using safe contents at that time, and helps parents.



<figure>

<img src="img/10.png" />


</figure></p>

<p>Also, by recording children&rsquo;s daily responses and sharing these with their parents, they can understand children&rsquo;s hidden feelings and preferences. As a future expansion, it will work as a platform of the entire family members including grandparents as if they are in the same living room even if they live far apart.</p>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide33.png" />


</figure>
After the implementation. we performed a qualitative and quantitative user evaluation and 75% of participants evaluated &ldquo;Very Positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;Positive&rdquo; against the whole concept. Therefore, the client decide to launch this App in the next year cycle with considering qualitative feedback comments. Currently, the client continues to develop Android version and they are planning to release this product in 2019.</p>

<h5 id="my-role">My Role</h5>

<p>I was employed as a project manager and a lead UX designer of an 10-person team consisting of designers, engineers and business strategists and managed the project from the concept creation to the implementation phases using methodologies of Design Thinking, Lean Startup and Agile Development. I am certified as both a practitioner of IBM Design Thinking and a Scrum Master, which means I can work consistently end to end as a professional user experience designer.



<figure>

<img src="img/Slide24.png" />


</figure>



<figure>

<img src="img/Slide25.png" />


</figure></p>

<p>Product design is actually an iterative journey of building, measuring and learning. With continuous discussion with users, clients, designers, engineers and business strategists, finally we developed and delivered an appropriate service for users.</p>




<figure>

<img src="img/Slide11.png" />


</figure>

<!-- Using design thinking, while focusing on customer-oriented thinking, we define the strong concept eventually to be released as a service running in the society. With the concept of lean startup, we verify and grow the service concept as a feasible business model. Finally we implement the business ecosystem designed with such a way of thinking to the world with agile development.

As a project manager and professional UX designer, I contributed to the project from the concept phase to the agile development phase. In terms of technology, customer experience and sustainable business model, my team designed entire new business ecosystem of the client.

In the concept phase, I planned a Design Thinking workshop with clients and created the initial concept of the service, prior to narrowing this down to a series of actionable steps in consideration of the conceptâ€™s implementation. Additionally, in the subsequent development phase, I have worked on continuously improving the quality of the product through a process of iterative prototyping and user evaluation. -->

<h5 id="background">Background</h5>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide1.png" />


</figure>
In 2016, new policy of deregulation of the electricity industry in Japan has begun, and a lot of new and emerging companies and startups have entered the electricity market and acquire users by user-centric services.</p>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide2.png" />


</figure>
<b>C-EP must</b> shift to a client first company and <b>provide user-centered services in order to improve its retention capability.</b></p>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide7.png" />


</figure>
At the beginning, in the concept phase, I facilitated 2-days IBM Design Thinking workshop with clients, created the initial concept of a new service. We divided the members into 2 teams (personas) and eventually created 6 promising concepts.



<figure>

<img src="img/Slide8.png" />


</figure></p>

<h5 id="target-user-and-insight">Target User and Insight</h5>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide3.png" />


</figure>
We decided <b>a dual-income working mother</b> as a primary user. In Japan, 49% of households are dual-income families in urban area and It is expected that this figure will continue to rise in the future.</p>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide4.png" />


</figure>
According to 10 interviews with working mother, we found <b>how hard working parents take care of little children.</b> When a working mother comes back to the home, she must do many houseworks with taking care of children. And finally we found 2 core insights we should tackle with.</p>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide5.png" />


</figure>
One is the problem that <b>recent mothers often handed out a smartphone to a child when they were busy and showed YouTube and animation.</b> <b>It causes less communication between parents and children.</b> Also, some young mothers even lose a way how to take care of children. They feel guilty to rely on a smartphone, but they can not quit it.</p>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide6.png" />


</figure>
The other insight is <b>mothers don&rsquo;t know children&rsquo;s feelings and preferences well.</b> According to our interview, even mothers who are communicating with children usually say that they do not understand children&rsquo;s feelings.</p>

<h5 id="initial-core-concept">Initial Core Concept</h5>




<figure>

<img src="img/Slide9.png" />


</figure>

<p>With iterative prototyping in collaboration with C-EP members, I came up with the idea that IoT toy plays and communicates with children when parents are busy. By recording childrenâ€™s daily responses and sharing these with their parents, family members can understand their hidden feelings and preferences.</p>

<h5 id="experience-design">Experience Design</h5>

<p>

<figure>

<img src="img/Slide12.png" />


</figure>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide15.png" />


</figure>
Considering the project period and budget constraints, I decided to launch the App version as the first MVP.
I regarded working mothers to <b>rely on smartphones as a new habit</b> and turn it into positive activities.</p>

<p>We developed an iOS app that can communicate with children when parents handed out a smartphone to them. By recording their daily responses and sharing these with parents, <b>the family members are able to understand the childrenâ€™s hidden feelings and preferences.</b></p>

<h5 id="collaborative-studio">Collaborative Studio</h5>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide13.png" />


</figure>
As a project manager, I planned to improve the parts of the product the needed it based on the research results. I opened a collaborative studio in which multiple members could simultaneously discuss various topics from a business plan to elements of UI that needed to be improved and tried to create an appropriate experience. I repeated this whole-day workshop every other week with not only internal designers but also C-EP members and then had a vote to decide the design direction with everyoneâ€™s opinion included.

</figure>



<figure>

<img src="img/Slide23.png" />


</figure>
For this project, it was necessary to create designs for iOS platforms because it was the most major platform among C-EP customers. We performed 30 interviews and improved our product iteratively. Using InVision, we performed interviews with a moving prototype mockup. Finally, we fixed requirements of comprehensive services and proceeded to the following development phase.</p>




<figure>

<img src="img/122.png" />


</figure>

<h5 id="finalize-ux-ui-in-sprints-of-development">Finalize UX/UI in sprints of development</h5>

<p>In the subsequent development phase, I have been working on continuously improving the quality of the product through a process of iterative prototyping and user evaluation. I have the certification of both a practitioner of IBM Design Thinking and a Scrum Master, so I can work consistently end to end from the concept creation to implementation phases as a professional user experience designer.</p>

<p>Finally my team designed and finalized 94 screens and interactions in the development phase.

<h5 id="result">Result</h5>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/Slide33.png" />


</figure>
After the implementation. we performed a qualitative and quantitative user evaluation. 234 dual-income households with children tested this App for 2 weeks, and 75% of people evaluated &ldquo;Good (55%)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Very Good (20%)&rdquo; against the whole concept. Therefore, the client decide to launch this App in the next year cycle with considering qualitative feedback comments. Currently, the client continues to develop Android version and they are planning to release this product in 2019.</p>

<h5 id="learning">Learning</h5>

<p>


<figure>

<img src="img/4.png" />


</figure>
I think service Design is Co-creation. Product design is a process of exploring an appropriate ecosystem comprising everyone, that is created by everyone, and is provided for everyone.</p>
